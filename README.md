# RAW Normalize

RAW Normalize is based on based on [Normalize.css], a project by Nicolas Gallagher, co-created with Jonathan Neal.

Those principal differences between RAW Normalize and Normalize.css:

  - All *margins* and *paddings* are removed.
  - Al *borders* are removed too

### Why RAW Normalize?

The idea of RAW Normalize is to have nothing that can break your layout while building your responsive site, not a predesigned site to build on.

With RAW Normalize you can set every with and height as you want, and you do not have to cancel any CSS rule while building you site.
